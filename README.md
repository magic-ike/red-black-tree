# Redâ€“black tree

## Assignment Instructions

In this assignment, you will complete the code for insertions in a Red-Black tree.  We've provided a framework with comments.  You should complete the sections labeled "TODO" 

You are also required to follow any directions accompanying comments such as "NOTE".
You can add/modify code anywhere, with the exception of the provided "main" (which we will use for testing).
You can use the constants RED and BLACK, instead of the ints 0 and 1, when appropriate.

## Notes

I ended up rewriting the insertion and rotation code from scratch using pseudocode from [CLRS (3rd Edition)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition) as a reference.
